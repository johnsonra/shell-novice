## Challenge 1

You can use two options at the same time. What does the command `ls` do when used with the `-l` option? What about if you use both the `-l` and the `-h` option? Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful nevertheless.


## Challenge 2

By default, `ls` lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order by name. The command `ls -t` lists items by time of last change instead of alphabetically. The command `ls -r` lists the contents of a directory in reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the `-t` and `-r` options? Hint: You may need to use the `-l` option to see the last changed dates.


## Challenge 3

Starting from `/Users/nelle/data`, which of the following commands could Nelle use to navigate to her home directory, which is `/Users/nelle`?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
* `cd .`
* `cd /`
* `cd /home/nelle`
* `cd ../..`
* `cd ~`
:::

::: {.column}
* `cd home`
* `cd ~/data/..`
* `cd`
* `cd ..`
:::

::::


## Challenge 4

Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`, what will `ls -F ../backup` display?

## Challenge 5

Using the filesystem diagram below (same as previous slide), if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`, and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order, what command(s) will result in the following output: `pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/`
